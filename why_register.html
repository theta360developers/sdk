        <h1>Why is Registration Required?</h1>
        <p>
          Although .guide is an independent site, we receive sponsorship from
          RICOH. In order to justify the value of this site to our sponsor, we
          report back to RICOH on popularity metrics for different types of
          content. .guide does not sell anything and there are no paid ads or
          endorsements on our sites. We succeed if the content we provide is of
          use to people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The public documentation on the theta-guide RICOH site does
          not cover all installation and getting started examples.
          We are slowly collecting tests from the community and augmenting
          community tests with our own tests. The process takes time. There are
          still many gaps in the documentation and it will take more time to solve
          these problems. Registration helps us verify the value of our work
          with the community. Thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you ever find information on this site that is useful, please let
          us know or let someone at RICOH know. The effort by you will help all
          of us to continue the exchange of community content.
